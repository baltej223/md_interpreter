# Markdown files interpreter
Make github like README in HTML site

**IT IS NOT A README FILE GENRATOR**
So basically if you want to write documetation for yourslef or want to write documentation which have a github like interface, you can use this js file that I made.

Put it in your readme file's head tag, but.. readme.md files don't have a html like interface..
```
<script src='https://baltej223.github.io/md_interpreter/main.js'>
